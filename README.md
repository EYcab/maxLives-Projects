# maxLives-Projects

There are 3 python files:

mostlyAlive.py: the main file contains year_with_max_population(path)--our core function and test_result(path) 

inputGenerator.py: the file used to generate random dataset in a csv file

unitTest.py: the file used to do unit tests on our year_with_max_population(path) function

Note:test_result(path) is a brute force approach to solve the problem yet it is not fast since it has 
    a O(n**2) run time while our year_with_max_population(path) has its linear run time
    
There are 4 csv testcase files and 1 large csv data file:
Yet,I pick testStar.csv and testMultiplePeaks.csv as my main testcases 
for the single peak and the multiple peaks testing 

Note:the large csv data file is to apply the test_result() code to test the correctness of the codes

There are 2 ipynb files:

GraphTesting.ipynb is to test and visualize our test_result() codes correctness

MaxLives.ipynb is to the correctness and performance of the test_result() codes

The way to open is to use terminal and type the below under your directory:

i.e.
ipython notebook GraphTesting.ipynb

Thus, since year_with_max_population(path) function passed all of our test cases, it is a better approach to 
our problem.
